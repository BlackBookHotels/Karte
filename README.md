# 🗺 Karte

Small library for opening a location or route in other popular iOS map apps.



## Quick Start

WIP



## Installation

Karte is available through Carthage/Punic and Cocoapods, take your pick.

// Cocoapods
pod 'Karte'
```



## Authors

## Credits

This library is based on [CMMapLauncher](https://github.com/citymapper/CMMapLauncher). Unfortunately development on that library seems to have been stopped, so this is a reimplementation in Swift including a few changes to make usage even more pleasant 😊



## "Karte"?

It's German for "Map" and that seemed fitting 🤷‍♀️
